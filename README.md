## About The Project

These days, most of the photos generated by our devices are quite large in resolution and in size. As developers, we may not need large images (>5mb) especially if you’re using it for a profile picture or so. A common solution so far was to resize the image after it was uploaded to the server. How about doing this at the client side and compressing the image before it reaches the server?
